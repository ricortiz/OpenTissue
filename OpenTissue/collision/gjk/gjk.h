        * GJK Algorithm.
        * This class implements the Gilbert, Johnson and Keerthi
        * collision detection algorithm, also known as GJK.
        *
        * The algorithm is an iterative simplex based algorithm, our
        * implementation is based on the original code implemented by
        * Gino van den Bergen in his GJK-engine (which later has become
        * part of his SOLID collision detection library), thanks Gino:-)
        *
        * For details on GJK, we refer to
        *
        *   [1] Uffe ??? and Niels ???:
        *       ???.
        *       DIKU master thesis no. 01-01-2, pp. 49-77
        *   [2] Gino van den Bergen:
        *       A Fast and Robust GJK Implementation for Collision Detection of Convex Objects.
        *       Journal of Graphics Tools, 4(2):7-25 (1999).
        *
        * In [1] there is an excellent explanation and proof of the
        * sub-algorithm in GJK, it also contains a new method for
        * dealing with numerical errors. The authors claim their method
        * is more robust than Gino's. We have not implemented it, but
        * sugest it as a possible resolution in case we ever get into
        * numerical problems with GJK.
        *
        * Support Mapping Function
        *
        *  p = get_support_point(v)
        *
        * This method is needed by GJK. The method computes
        * the extremum point in a given direction of a convex
        * point set.
        *
        * @param v      A pointer to a vector, holding the direction
        * @return       A pointer to a vector, which upon return should
        *               contain the extrenum point in the specified
        *               direction.
